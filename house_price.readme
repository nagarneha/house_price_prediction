# project Name -> 🏠 House price prediction 

Overview -> 
           This project predicts house prices using machine learning regression models. It covers data preprocessing, 
           exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building with Python.
           This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of rooms, location,
           and other property-related factors.
